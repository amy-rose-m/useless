Some code for a useless machine I built for my daughters...

It's a bit different to a standard useless machines in that its "lid" is actually a door (and thus requires its own servo) the arm (another servo) is connected to a fluffy toy horse ... whose neck is controlled by a third servo.

It's the first such machine I've built, indeed my first real foray into hardware (I'm a software guy with a penchant for woodworking) and my first use of an Arduino.  It was harder than expected but at least it works :-)  Hopefully now my kids may enjoy it enough to want to learn how to program their own reactions.  They'll need hand-holding but I'm fine with that!
